## Past Winner Story 1: Team Hollo, Hong Kong - 2020 Imagine Cup World Champion 

From the [Microsoft Tech Community Blog](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/student-developer-blog/past-imagine-cup-competitors-where-are-they-now/ba-p/2220213): Since winning the trophy in 2020, Hollo has been hard at work expanding their business and growing their team. We chatted to Co-founder and CEO, Cameron van Breda, to see how Hollo’s grown across the past year. As a smart AI-powered preventative platform, Hollo’s app aims to improve individual mental health by integrating Machine Learning with suggestive diagnosis, therapy, and continual monitoring.  

“{We’ve} been working on researching our AI technology further as well as growing our team and product. We've continued to work with local mental health NGOs and professionals to get the app and supporting web-app to be more polished over time.” Cameron shared the team’s 3 biggest achievements from 2020, which include: growing their team to a group of 10 (including data scientists, developers, psychologists, and interns), developing his personal management skills, and securing more business alliances for future projects.  

The team also launched a new business under Hollo this year, Blossom, targeted towards enhancing women’s wellbeing. “Blossom was {our} way of testing how we can take the data we'll have on our users and give them more value and bring them closer together as a community. Our team thought this would be a great experience to bring impact to a space that is really important.  Blossom specifically targets helping {women} feel better…whilst building infrastructure as a social enterprise to bring impact to young women with workshops and community events around wellbeing in general.” 

As part of their prize for winning the World Championship, the team also had the opportunity to meet with Microsoft CEO, Satya Nadella, earlier this year to receive mentorship and advice. The top takeaway for Hollo? “We took the chance to ask Satya for some feedback on a proposed research collaboration with the Microsoft Research departments that focus on AI. Our vision is to connect researchers from Microsoft, Hollo, and the University of Hong Kong, to create a breeding ground of innovation and application of AI for good. We felt like the values of Microsoft in using AI for increasing accessibility in Healthcare aligned with our goals, and so we opened the door for shared value creation.”
