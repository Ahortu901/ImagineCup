### Lesson 2/2: Parting Advice

Thank you for engaging with this training! We hope it was useful and that it helps you and your team prepare for a successful Imagine Cup experience! Throughout this training, you have received lots of advice - but our main piece of advice is to have fun! Having the opportunity to compete together with friends and classmates is awesome, and we encourage you not to forget that this is an experience that you will remember for the rest of your life!

But this isn't goodbye! We'd love to continue connecting with you on our Imagine Cup Discord community. It's the best place meet other Imagine Cup participants around the world, get mentorship, and learn about even more resources. Join from [your Imagine Cup account page](https://imaginecup.microsoft.com/account)- we can't wait to see you there ðŸ˜Š
